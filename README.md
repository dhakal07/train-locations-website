Train Locations Website

A simple website showing real-time train locations in Finland using the Digitraffic API.

## Features
- Fetches train locations from the Digitraffic API.
- Displays them on a map with Leaflet.js.
- Auto-updates every 10 seconds.
- Shows train number and speed in popups.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Page structure.
- **CSS**: Basic styling.
- **JavaScript**: API fetching and map updates.
- **Leaflet.js**: Interactive map with OpenStreetMap.
- **Digitraffic API**: Train location data.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/train-locations-website.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Learning Journey
As a second-year IT student, I used my skills in programming, data communications, and UI design from my Centria courses to build this project. It was my first time using an API and Leaflet.js, but I learned step-by-step!

## Future Ideas
- Add a filter for specific trains.
- Improve the design with more CSS.

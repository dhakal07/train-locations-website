## Learning Journey
As a IT student at Centria, I used my programming knowlwdge, UI/UX, and software engineering skills to build this. Adding auto-updates and a train list taught me how to handle real-time data and improve usability!. I knew it would be tough but i enjoyed the assignment and it was a great learning curve.
